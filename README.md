# Note-Keeper

## Team:

- Fares

## User Story

- As a user, I want to store some notes/text online.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all my stored notes.
- As a user, I want some security to my notes, username and password required to see the note.

## How did we make this

- We started by reading the requirements
- We then created the server files and file stucture.
- We worked as a pair, and Imad made style..
- We faced alot of limitations in this work, mainly the API was so limited, 10 post requests
  in 24h.
